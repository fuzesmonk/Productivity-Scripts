## Productivity Pomodoro 
A simple python script that uses an implementation of the pomodoro method to help with productivity to help with staving off burnout when working on projects/homework. 
It uses the vlc python package to play sounds for the start and stop of each session.

###  Usage
You can set the length of the work sessions and the breaks. The weights of each reward can be changed so that some rewards are more likely than others.
